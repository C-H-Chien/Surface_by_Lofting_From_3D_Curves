# curve_sampling

This tool is use to convert ABC dataset's parametrized curve representation to 3d curve points. 

## Problems

Ellipse case is not well supported and b-spline may not be sampled successfully sometimes. However, there are still a plenty of pick in the ABC dataset. The parameter provided by the dataset is too few some time. Sub-divide may be needed.
