% function [filt_sig, dx] = resampled_filter_2d(sig, filt_fun_2d, sigma, n)
%
% Filter the signal at subpixel locations using resampled filters.
%   Resampled fitlers are simply filters whose analytic centers have been
%   shifted.
%
%   The benefits of this operation are:
%     1) Increased sampling of the response surface allows more small scale
%        edges to be detected. NMS typically relies on 3 neighboring pixels
%        to make its decision and also fit a parabola to find the subpixel
%        location of the edge. Edges at at only 1 or 2-pixel wide do not
%        pass this test and are thus rejected. Subpixel sampling of the
%        reponses surface allows these to be retained.
%
%     2) Increased sampling also results in smoother response surfaces and
%        hence subpixel localization improves.
%
% Parameters:
%    sig:          original image to be filtered
%    filt_fun_2d:  a 2d filter kernel that can be resampled (see G_2d_op)
%    n:            2^n number of subdivions within the pixel 
%
% Output:
%   filt_sig : resulting response signal 
%              Note that filt_sig will be 2^(2n) times larger than sig.
%
%   dx:        density of interpolation  = 1/(2^n);
